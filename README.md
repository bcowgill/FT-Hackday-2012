FT-Hackday-2012
===============

My Entry into FT Hackday 2012.

The Financial Times inaugural hack day was about using their content API.

My entry used the API to grab articles with images and present a screen
saver like falling display of articles. Don't expect the code to run any
more as the content api access keys have long changed.

TODO - dig up the video must still be on jing/streamload somewhere.

This is just a code sample showing what can be done in a 24ish hour period.

Yes, I even wrote unit tests for the code.

Made use of the HTML5 boilerplate / modernizr / jquery mobile / qunit.
